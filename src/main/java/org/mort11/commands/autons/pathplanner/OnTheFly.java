/*TODO: WORK IN PROGRESS
1: figure out if waypoints are constants based on field pose or if they need to be corrected with vision/odometry
2: figure out how to flip from red alliance to blue alliance
3: figure out how to follow a pre-generated path after the path that was generated on the fly
4: figure out difference between pathfinding and on the fly path generation https://pathplanner.dev/pplib-pathfinding.html (I think I need to do pathfinding not onthefly)*/
